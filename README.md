>> Abstract and System Design:
Abstract—
The aim of  the project was to build a task management system that could aid in developing a large-scale project. The software allows you to build new tasks, assign tasks to users, set due dates on tasks, and track the state of tasks from beginning to end. The users also have the ability to add comments to each task, The project also has an activity management for each task which records all the activities performed on a task and maintains them independently. The software and hardware needed are readily available and simple to use. The Home page of the application gives you a good understanding of what task each customer is assigned to and the state in which these tasks are. This would aid in knowing if you would want to assign more tasks to this user and also the progress he has made so far in the tasks the user is assigned.
This application was developed using Spring Tool Suite with Java 11, Spring Boot, and Hibernate JPA. MVC Framework was used throughout the project wherein each action is performed with our model carrying the data, Controller holding the business logic, and view as our front end pages.
Keywords— SpringBoot, MVC Framework, JAVA, Hibernate
